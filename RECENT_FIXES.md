# 🔧 Recent Fixes & Improvements

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1️⃣ **Permission Re-request Issue** (FIXED)

**Problem:**
- When student denied microphone/Bluetooth permission and clicked OK
- The browser didn't re-ask for permission
- Refreshing page also didn't help

**Solution:**
✅ **Microphone Permission:**
- OK button now properly retries permission request
- Added helpful instruction: "ℹ️ If blocked: Click the lock/info icon in your browser address bar → Reset permissions"
- Changed button text from "OK" to "Allow Permission" with mic icon
- Added subtitle: "Tap to request permission again"

✅ **Bluetooth Permission:**
- "Try Again" button properly retries Bluetooth scan
- Added same helpful instruction for resetting browser permissions
- Better error messaging

**How it works:**
```dart
onPressed: () {
  setState(() {
    showPermissionDialog = false;
  });
  // Retry permission request after dialog closes
  Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 300), () {
    checkMicrophonePermission();
  });
}
```

**Note for Students:**
If browser permanently blocked permissions:
1. Click the 🔒 (lock) or ℹ️ (info) icon in address bar
2. Find "Microphone" or "Bluetooth" 
3. Change from "Block" to "Ask" or "Allow"
4. Refresh the page

### 2️⃣ **Custom OTP Timer** (NEW FEATURE)

**Problem:**
- OTP timer was fixed at 20 seconds
- No flexibility for different class sizes or scenarios

**Solution:**
✅ Added **settings button** (⚙️) next to "Activate OTP" button

✅ **Timer Selection Dialog** with options:
- **10 seconds** - Quick attendance for small classes
- **20 seconds** (Default) - Standard timing
- **30 seconds** - More time for larger classes
- **Custom input** - Enter any value from 5-60 seconds

✅ **UI Features:**
- Settings icon appears only when OTP is not active
- Button label dynamically shows selected duration: "Activate OTP (30s)"
- Active timer shows: "OTP Active (25s)"
- Toast notification confirms timer change: "Timer set to 30 seconds"

**Firebase Integration:**
```javascript
attendance_sessions/{sessionId}/
  otp_duration: 30  // Custom duration stored
```

**Student Side:**
- Automatically fetches custom duration from Firebase
- Timer countdown uses teacher's selected duration
- Submission deadline adjusted to match custom duration

---

### 3️⃣ **Auto-End Session on Timer Expiry** (NEW FEATURE)

**Problem:**
- OTP timer expired but session remained active
- Students could potentially submit after timer ended
- Teacher had to manually end session

**Solution:**
✅ **Automatic session termination** when OTP timer reaches 0

**What happens:**
1. Timer counts down: 30... 29... 28... 3... 2... 1... 0
2. OTP automatically deactivates
3. **Session automatically ends** 🛑
4. Firebase updated with `is_ended: true`
5. Students see "Session Ended" screen
6. No more submissions possible

**Code:**
```dart
if (timerSeconds > 0) {
  setState(() {
    timerSeconds--;
  });
} else {
  // Auto-end session when timer expires
  deactivateOTP();
  endAttendance();  // ← NEW: Auto-end
  timer.cancel();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents late submissions
- ✅ Ensures attendance window is strictly enforced
- ✅ Teacher doesn't need to manually end session
- ✅ Clean automatic closure
