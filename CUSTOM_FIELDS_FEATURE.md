# Custom Fields Feature - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
Custom fields (e.g., Age, Emp ID) were being collected from students during event check-in but were **not being displayed** anywhere:
- ❌ Not visible in the admin's live participants list
- ❌ Not included in the PDF export

This made custom fields essentially useless since teachers couldn't see or export the collected data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ShareEventScreen - Live Participants List
**What changed:** Custom field values now display below each participant's name in the live list.

**Example Display:**
```
John Doe
Age: 25  Emp ID: E12345
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extracts `custom_fields` map from each participant's data
- Displays field-value pairs below the participant name
- Uses smaller, secondary text color for visual hierarchy

### 2. ShareEventScreen - PDF Export
**What changed:** PDF now includes custom fields in a table format.

**PDF Layout:**
- **Without custom fields:** Simple numbered list (as before)
- **With custom fields:** Table format with columns for each field

**Example PDF Table:**
```
#  | Roll Number | Age | Emp ID
1  | 101         | 25  | E12345
2  | 102         | 23  | E12346
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Checks if event has custom fields defined
- Generates table header with field names
- Maps participant data to table rows
- Falls back to simple list if no custom fields

### 3. ShareAttendanceScreen - Classroom Attendance
**What added:** QR Code and PDF export (parity with events)

**New Features:**
- ✅ QR Code display for easy scanning
- ✅ PDF export with proper formatting
- ✅ Both PDF and text export options

## Files Modified

### Event Attendance
- `lib/pages/ShareEventScreen.dart`
  - Enhanced participants list to show custom fields
  - Updated PDF export with table format for custom fields

### Classroom Attendance
- `lib/pages/ShareAttendanceScreen.dart`
  - Added QR code display
  - Added PDF export functionality
  - Split export into PDF and Text options

## Testing Checklist

### Event with Custom Fields
- [ ] Create event with custom fields (e.g., Age, Emp ID)
- [ ] Have students check in with all required data
- [ ] Verify custom fields appear under student names in live list
- [ ] Export PDF and verify table format includes all custom fields
- [ ] Verify all field values are correctly displayed

### Event without Custom Fields
- [ ] Create event without custom fields
- [ ] Have students check in
- [ ] Verify simple list format (no table)
- [ ] Export PDF and verify simple numbered list format

### Classroom Attendance
- [ ] Create classroom attendance session
- [ ] Verify QR code displays correctly
- [ ] Have students mark attendance
- [ ] Export as PDF and verify formatting
- [ ] Export as Text and verify content

## Data Structure

### Event with Custom Fields
```json
{
  "event_sessions": {
    "sessionId": {
      "event_name": "Tech Fest 2025",
      "custom_fields": [
        {"name": "Age", "type": "number"},
        {"name": "Emp ID", "type": "text"}
      ],
      "participants": {
        "participantId": {
          "entry": "John Doe",
          "custom_fields": {
            "Age": "25",
            "Emp ID": "E12345"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Visibility**: Teachers can now see all collected information
2. **Proper Export**: PDF includes all custom field data in organized format
3. **Feature Parity**: Classroom attendance now has same features as events
4. **Backward Compatible**: Events without custom fields still work with simple format

## Future Enhancements

- Add search/filter by custom field values
- Export to Excel with custom fields as columns
- Custom field validation (required/optional)
- Field types with proper input controls (date picker, dropdown, etc.)
