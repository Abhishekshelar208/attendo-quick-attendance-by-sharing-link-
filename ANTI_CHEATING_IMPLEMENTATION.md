# Anti-Cheating Attendance System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Tab Monitoring Service
**File:** `lib/services/tab_monitor_service.dart`
- Detects tab switches and minimization
- Tracks focus loss count and duration
- Reports cheating flags to Firebase
- Calculates severity levels (CLEAN, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)

### 2. OTP Generation
**File:** `lib/pages/CreateAttendanceScreen.dart`
- Generates random 4-digit OTP when session is created
- Stores OTP in Firebase: `otp`, `otp_active`, `otp_start_time`
- Database structure updated to include cheating_flags

### 3. Teacher's Share Screen (NEW)
**File:** `lib/pages/ShareAttendanceScreen.dart` (replaced)
**Features:**
- ✅ Displays 4-digit OTP prominently
- ✅ "Activate OTP" button with 20-second countdown timer
- ✅ Real-time attendance monitoring
- ✅ Cheating flags display with severity indicators
- ✅ Live countdown showing remaining seconds
- ✅ Color-coded student badges (Green = Clean, Red = Flagged)

**Teacher Flow:**
```
1. Create attendance session (OTP generated automatically)
2. Share link to students
3. Wait for students to open link and enter roll numbers
4. Click "Activate OTP (20s)" button
5. Announce OTP verbally or write on board
6. Watch 20-second countdown
7. Students frantically enter OTP
8. See live attendance + cheating flags
```

### 4. Student Attendance Screen
**Status:** OLD VERSION backed up, NEW VERSION needs creation

**Required Features:**
```
Step 1: Roll Number Entry
├─ Input field for roll number

Step 2: Microphone Permission Check
├─ Request mic access
├─ If DENIED → Show warning dialog with "OK" button
│  └─ Click "OK" → Request again (loop until allowed)

Step 3: OTP Waiting Screen
├─ Display: "Waiting for teacher..."
├─ Start tab monitoring (TabMonitorService)
├─ Warning: "Do NOT switch tabs!"
└─ Listen for otp_active = true in Firebase

Step 4: OTP Entry Screen (Active)
├─ Show OTP input field (4 digits)
├─ 20-second countdown timer
├─ Continue tab monitoring
├─ Monitor mic usage (continuous check)
└─ "Submit" button

Step 5: Validation
├─ Check OTP matches Firebase
├─ Check submission within 20 seconds
├─ Check tab monitoring flags
├─ Check mic was not in use
├─ Submit to Firebase with all flags
└─ Navigate to confirmation screen
```

## 🎓 HOW IT WORKS (Final System)

### Teacher:
```
1. Creates session → OTP: 7392 (auto-generated)
2. Shares link in WhatsApp
3. Students open link + enter roll numbers
4. Teacher clicks "Activate OTP (20s)"
5. Teacher announces: "OTP is 7392"
6. Watches countdown: 20...19...18...
7. Students submit
8. Teacher sees: ✅ 42, ✅ 28, 🔴 51 (flagged)
```

### Student:
```
1. Opens link
2. Enters roll number: "42"
3. Browser asks mic permission → Click "Allow"
4. Sees: "Waiting for teacher..."
5. Tab monitoring starts (can't switch tabs)
6. Teacher activates OTP
7. Sees: OTP input field + 20s timer
8. Enters: "7392"
9. Clicks Submit (at 15s remaining)
10. Attendance marked ✅
```

### Cheater Student:
```
1-6. Same as above
7. Switches to WhatsApp tab to share OTP ❌
8. Tab monitor detects: focusLostCount = 1
9. Submits OTP
10. Marked but FLAGGED 🔴
11. Teacher sees: "Roll 42 - Tab switched (MEDIUM severity)"
```

## ⚡ CURRENT STATUS

**Progress: 60%**

✅ Backend ready (OTP, flags, monitoring)
✅ Teacher UI complete
⚠️ Student UI needs completion

**Estimated time to complete:** 2-3 hours
**Critical path:** StudentAttendanceScreen implementation
