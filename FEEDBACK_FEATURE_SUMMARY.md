## 🔐 Security & Privacy Features

### Hybrid Abuse Detection Approach

#### **When Names Are ENABLED:**
- Students enter their name explicitly
- Teacher sees: "John Doe: Great feedback!"
- Device ID stored but not shown
- Standard accountability

#### **When Names Are DISABLED (Anonymous):**
- Students see "Submit anonymously"
- Teacher sees: "Anonymous #1: Great feedback!"
- **Device ID secretly stored** (encrypted in backend)
- Device tracking warning shown to students

#### **Abuse Management:**
1. **Flag Submission:**
   - Teacher clicks "Flag" button
   - Submission moves to "Flagged" tab
   - Device ID revealed: "Device: ...abc12345"

2. **Block Device:**
   - Teacher clicks "Block Device"
   - Device ID added to `blocked_devices` list
   - Future submission attempts from that device show: "Your device has been blocked"

3. **Unflag:**
   - Teacher can unflag if mistake
   - Submission returns to normal tab
