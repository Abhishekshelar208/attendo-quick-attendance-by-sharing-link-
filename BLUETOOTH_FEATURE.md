# 🔵 Bluetooth Proximity Feature

## Overview
The Bluetooth proximity feature ensures students are **physically present in the classroom** by verifying they can detect the teacher's Bluetooth device. This prevents remote attendance marking.

---

## 📋 Implementation Summary

### **Student Flow (Web)**
1. **Roll Number Entry** → Student enters their roll number
2. **Microphone Check** → Verifies mic permission (anti-call detection)
3. **OTP Waiting** → Wait for teacher to activate OTP window
4. **OTP Entry** → Enter 4-digit OTP within 20 seconds
5. **🆕 Bluetooth Check** → Scan and select teacher's device
6. **Submission** → Auto-submit after successful Bluetooth verification

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Web Bluetooth API**
- Uses **Web Bluetooth API** available in Chrome/Edge browsers
- Student's browser scans for nearby Bluetooth devices
- Student must **manually select** teacher's device from a picker
- Connection verifies physical proximity

### **Files Created**
```
lib/services/
├── bluetooth_proximity_service.dart          (Platform-aware wrapper)
├── bluetooth_proximity_service_web.dart      (Web implementation)
└── bluetooth_proximity_service_mobile.dart   (Mobile stub - always passes)
```

### **Key Methods**
```dart
// Main method - Shows device picker to student
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> performProximityCheck() async

// Check if Bluetooth is available
Future<bool> checkBluetoothAvailability() async

// Scan for nearby devices
Future<bool> scanForNearbyDevices({int timeoutSeconds = 10}) async
```

## 🎨 UI Flow

### **Step 5: Bluetooth Check Screen**

#### **State 1: Scanning** 🔍
- Blue spinning loader
- "🔍 Scanning for devices..."
- "Please select teacher's device from the list"
- Browser shows native Bluetooth device picker

#### **State 2: Success** ✅
- Green gradient background
- Bluetooth connected icon
- "✅ Device Found!"
- Shows selected device name
- "Proximity verified! Submitting attendance..."
- Auto-submits after 800ms

#### **State 3: Failed** ❌
- Red error state
- "❌ Bluetooth Check Failed"
- "Unable to detect teacher's device"
- "Try Again" button to retry
- Info: "This verifies you are physically present in the classroom"

## 🗄️ Firebase Data Structure

```javascript
attendance_sessions/
  {sessionId}/
    students/
      {studentId}/
        entry: "101"
        device_id: "xyz123"

        otp_verified: true
        submission_time_seconds: 12
        bluetooth_verified: true        // ✅ NEW
        bluetooth_device: "Teacher's iPhone"  // ✅ NEW
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Why This Works**
1. **Physical Proximity Required**
   - Bluetooth range is typically 10-30 meters
   - Student must be in the same room as teacher

2. **Manual Device Selection**
   - Student sees a list of ALL nearby Bluetooth devices
   - Must identify and select teacher's specific device
   - Can't fake this remotely

3. **Teacher's Device Must Be Discoverable**
   - Teacher needs Bluetooth ON
   - Device should be visible/discoverable

### **Cheating Prevention**
- ✅ Can't mark attendance from home (no Bluetooth access)
- ✅ Can't fake Bluetooth scan (browser API required)
- ✅ Device name recorded (audit trail)
- ✅ Combined with OTP, mic check, and tab monitoring

## 👨‍🏫 Teacher Instructions

### **Before Class**
1. **Enable Bluetooth** on your phone/laptop
2. **Make device discoverable** (in Bluetooth settings)
3. **Remember your device name** (e.g., "John's iPhone")

### **During Attendance**
1. Start attendance session
2. Share link with students
3. **Activate OTP** (20-second window)
4. **Tell students your device name** (verbally or write on board)
5. Students will see Bluetooth picker and select your device
6. Monitor live attendance and cheating flags

### **Troubleshooting**
- If students can't find device: Check Bluetooth is ON and discoverable
- If many devices appear: Tell students your exact device name
- For large classrooms: Move around or use Bluetooth beacon

---

## 🎓 Student Instructions

### **Step-by-Step**
1. Click attendance link on your **laptop/computer** (web browser)
2. Enter your roll number
3. **Allow microphone permission** when prompted
4. Wait for teacher to activate OTP
5. Enter the 4-digit OTP teacher announces
6. When Bluetooth picker appears:
   - Look for teacher's device name (teacher will tell you)
   - Select the correct device
   - Click "Pair" or "Connect"
7. If successful → Attendance auto-submitted! ✅

### **Troubleshooting**
- **No devices showing?** → Turn ON your laptop's Bluetooth
- **Can't find teacher's device?** → Ask teacher for exact device name
- **Connection failed?** → Move closer to teacher and try again
- **Picker cancelled?** → Click "Try Again" button
