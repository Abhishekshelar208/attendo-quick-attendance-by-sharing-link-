# Bluetooth Device Name Validation Feature

## Overview
This feature ensures that students can **ONLY** mark attendance by connecting to the correct teacher's device named **"Attendo: Teachers Device"**. Any attempt to connect to other Bluetooth devices will be blocked with a clear error message.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Teacher Side (Mobile App)
**When teacher activates Bluetooth:**
- Device name is automatically changed to **"Attendo: Teachers Device"**
- Device name is displayed prominently in the UI
- Students are informed to look for this specific device name

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/pages/ShareAttendanceScreen.dart` - Sets Bluetooth name when activating
- `lib/services/bluetooth_name_service.dart` - Service for setting device name
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/attendo/MainActivity.java` - Native Android code

### 2. Student Side (Web App)
**Device Name Validation:**
- Bluetooth service validates the selected device name
- Only accepts connections to **"Attendo: Teachers Device"**
- Rejects any other device with a detailed error message

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/bluetooth_proximity_service_web.dart` - Added strict validation
- `lib/pages/StudentAttendanceScreen_web.dart` - Added error handling and UI updates

## User Experience Flow

### For Teachers:
1. Create attendance session
2. Click "Activate Bluetooth"
3. Device is renamed to "Attendo: Teachers Device"
4. UI shows the device name clearly
5. Teacher informs students to look for this name

### For Students:

#### Step 1: Bluetooth Check Screen
- Student sees instruction: **"Look for this device name: 'Attendo: Teachers Device'"**
- Green highlighted box shows the exact device name to select
- Student clicks "Check Proximity" button
- Browser shows Bluetooth device picker

#### Step 2: Device Selection
**Scenario A - Correct Device Selected:**
- Student selects "Attendo: Teachers Device"
- ✅ Validation passes
- Success message: "Device Found! Attendo: Teachers Device"
- Student proceeds to next step

**Scenario B - Wrong Device Selected:**
- Student selects any other device (e.g., "SM-G991B", "Pixel 7", "AirPods")
- ❌ Validation fails immediately
- Error dialog appears with:
  - Red box showing: "❌ You selected: [wrong device name]"
  - Green box showing: "✅ You must connect to: 'Attendo: Teachers Device'"
  - Warning: "❌ ATTENDANCE NOT MARKED"
  - Clear message: You can only mark attendance by connecting to your teacher's device
  - "Try Again" button to retry

#### Step 3: Final Verification (After OTP)
- Same validation happens again before final attendance submission
- If wrong device: Same detailed error dialog
- If correct device: Attendance is marked successfully

## Technical Details

### Validation Logic
```dart
static const String REQUIRED_DEVICE_NAME = 'Attendo: Teachers Device';

// In performProximityCheck():
if (deviceNameStr != REQUIRED_DEVICE_NAME) {
  return {
    'success': false,
    'deviceFound': false,
    'error': 'Invalid device selected',
    'wrongDevice': true,
    'selectedDeviceName': deviceNameStr,
    'requiredDeviceName': REQUIRED_DEVICE_NAME,
  };
}
```

### Error Response Structure
When wrong device is selected:
```dart
{
  'success': false,
  'deviceFound': false,
  'error': 'Invalid device selected',
  'wrongDevice': true,  // Flag for wrong device error
  'selectedDeviceName': 'SM-G991B',  // What student selected
  'requiredDeviceName': 'Attendo: Teachers Device'  // What is required
}
```

### UI Error Dialog
- **Title:** "Wrong Device!" with error icon
- **Content:** 
  - Shows selected device in red box
  - Shows required device in green box
  - Warning message about attendance not marked
  - Instructions to try again with correct device
- **Action:** "Try Again" button to retry connection

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Proxy Attendance:** Students cannot use their own devices or friends' devices
2. **Requires Physical Presence:** Student must be near teacher's device
3. **Clear Validation:** Explicit device name matching prevents confusion
4. **User-Friendly Errors:** Students know exactly what went wrong and how to fix it
5. **No False Positives:** Only exact name match is accepted

## Testing Checklist

### Teacher App:
- [ ] Bluetooth activation changes device name to "Attendo: Teachers Device"
- [ ] Device name is displayed in UI after activation
- [ ] Check device settings to confirm name change

### Student Web App:
- [ ] Initial Bluetooth screen shows required device name clearly
- [ ] Selecting "Attendo: Teachers Device" → Success ✅
- [ ] Selecting any other device → Error dialog with details ❌
- [ ] Error dialog shows correct device names (selected vs required)
- [ ] "Try Again" button allows retry
- [ ] Same validation works during final Bluetooth check (after OTP)
- [ ] Attendance is NOT marked if wrong device is selected

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Teacher Names:** Include teacher's name in device name (e.g., "Attendo: Prof. Smith")
2. **QR Code Verification:** Add additional layer with teacher-specific QR codes
3. **Geofencing:** Combine Bluetooth with location verification
4. **Session-Specific Names:** Use session ID in device name for multiple concurrent sessions
5. **Analytics:** Track wrong device connection attempts for security monitoring

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Student sees error even with correct device
**Solution:** 
- Check if teacher's device name was properly set
- Verify Bluetooth permissions are granted
- Clear browser cache and retry

**Issue:** Teacher's device name doesn't change
**Solution:**
- Check Bluetooth permissions in Android settings
- Ensure app has BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission
- Try restarting Bluetooth adapter

**Issue:** Browser doesn't show Bluetooth picker
**Solution:**
- Check if browser supports Web Bluetooth API (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Ensure HTTPS or localhost (required for Web Bluetooth)
- Check if Bluetooth blocked in browser settings
